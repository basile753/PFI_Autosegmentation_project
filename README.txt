This Git repository aims to be the workingplace of the PFI (patellofemoral instability) automatic segmentation and simulation project, part of Annagh's Thesis proposal, directed by Allison clouthier for the uOttawa.

The goal is to develop a ready-to-use software that can predict the risks of PFI for a specific young person from its MRI data.

To do so, the software will perform an automatic-segmentation made by a Machine Learning model, trained on a specific dataset of 70 teenager's knee MRIs with background of knee injuries (PFI, ACL...). Then a few kinematic simulation will be done from the previously segmented musculoskeletal model in order to assess the risk of PFI.

Read the following thesis for more information : INSERT ANNAGH'S THESIS

IMPORTANT to use the project, create a VirtualEnvironment based on Python3.7 with the latest "mpunet" module installed.
