Here are stored all the Machine Learning Models (pre-trained or trained on our dataset) we will use during the project.
Their results and scores information are also stored in their folder.

Here an explanation of the nomenclature : 

	-Example 1 : MPUNET_RAND_30TR_15TE_03 --> means that the model is a multiplanar model (MPUNET) trained on a random sample (RAND) of 30 patients (30TR) and tested on 15 others (15TE). Finally it's the third of its kind (03)"
        -Example 2 : MPUNET_5CV_30TR_15TE --> means the model had been tested in a 5 group cross-validation process (5CV) on groups of 30 training data and 15 testing data")
